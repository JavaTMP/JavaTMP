# How to Make an NFT

Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are exploding in popularity these days. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make (i.e.,
mint) and sell an NFT.

## What Are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)?

NFTs are tokens based on a blockchain that represent ownership of a digital asset. NFTs are built on a blockchain and
are used to guarantee ownership of an asset. an NFT is proof of ownership in digital form. Most NFTs are based on
the `Ethereum` blockchain network.

An NFT is a unique digital asset that is not directly replaceable with another digital asset (thus the name "
non-fungible"). Many physical assets are also non-fungible. A "fungible" token, by contrast, is one that is replaceable
with another one identical to it. Ether is the fungible token that trades on the Ethereum network, meaning one Ether is
identical to another. But each NFT is unique; there isn't another one exactly like it out there, so they are
non-fungible -- or unable to exactly replace another.

Code is written into this digital token and recorded using the blockchain network it's based on (again, usually on
Ethereum) to prove a list of historical ownership and the current owner of a unique digital asset. An NFT can represent
any digital creation -- art, music, videos, writing, etc.

## Pick your item

you'll need to determine what unique digital asset you want to turn into an NFT. It can be a custom painting, picture,
music, video game collectible, meme, GIF, or even a tweet. An NFT is a unique digital item with a sole owner. That
rarity gives an NFT value.

## Choose your blockchain

Start the process of minting your unique digital asset into an NFT. That begins by determining the blockchain technology
you intend to use for your NFT. The most popular among NFT artists and creators is Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH). Other popular
options include Tezos, Polkadot, Cosmos, and Binance Smart Chain.

## Set up your digital wallet

* If you don't already have a digital wallet, you'll want to set one up to create your NFT since you'll need some
  cryptocurrency to fund your initial investment.
* The wallet will provide you with access to your digital assets.
* The top NFT wallets include Metamask, Math Wallet, AlphaWallet, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet.
* Once you set up your digital wallet, you'll want to buy some cryptocurrency. Most NFT platforms accept Ether, the
  cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform.

## Select your NFT marketplace

* Once you have a digital wallet and some cryptocurrency, it's time to start creating (and, hopefully, selling) your
  NFT. For that, you'll need to choose an NFT marketplace.
* OpenSea is usually a good place to start. It allows you to mint your own NFT, and it's a leader in NFT sales.
* After selecting your NFT marketplace, you'll need to connect it to your digital wallet. That will allow you to pay the
  necessary fees to mint your NFT and hold any sales proceeds.

## Upload your file

* You're now finally ready to mint your NFT. Your chosen NFT marketplace should have a step-by-step guide for uploading
  your digital file to their platform.
* That process will enable you to turn your digital file (a PNG, GIF, MP3, or other file type) into a marketable NFT.

## Set up the sales process

The final stage in the NFT minting process is to decide how you want to monetize your NFT. Depending on the platform,
you can:
Sell it at a fixed price, Set a timed auction, Start an unlimited auction.

Unfortunately, the fees to mint and sell an NFT can be costly and confusing. Because of that, it's important to take a
close look at the costs you'll have to pay to make and sell your NFT to make sure they're worthwhile.
