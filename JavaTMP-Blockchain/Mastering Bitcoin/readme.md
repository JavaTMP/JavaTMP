# Mastering Bitcoin

Bitcoin is not simply a digital currency, but a network of trust that could also provide
the basis for so much more than just currencies. It isn’t money, it’s a decentralized
trust network. it was the most exciting technology I had encountered since the internet.

This book will teach you how cryptographic currencies work, how to use them, and how to
develop software that works with them.

Nature demonstrates that decentralized systems can be resilient and can produce emergent
complexity and incredible sophistication without the need for a central authority,
hierarchy, or complex parts.

Bitcoin is a highly sophisticated decentralized trust network that can support myriad
financial processes. The bitcoin network is a resilient network of simple nodes following
simple rules that together can do amazing things without any central coordination.

## CHAPTER 1: Introduction

### What Is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis of a digital
money ecosystem. The coins are implied in transactions that transfer value from sender to
recipient.

Users of bitcoin own keys that allow them to prove ownership of bitcoin in the bitcoin
network. With these keys they can sign transactions to unlock the value and spend it by
transferring it to a new owner.

Possession of the key that can sign a transaction is the only prerequisite to spending
bitcoin, putting the control entirely in the hands of each user.

bitcoin is also the name of the protocol, a peer-to-peer network, and a distributed
computing innovation.

### History of Bitcoin

The bitcoin network started in 2009, based on a reference implementation published by
Nakamoto with the publication of a paper
titled "[Bitcoin: A Peerto- Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
."

### Bitcoin Uses, Users, and Their Stories

Bitcoin is an innovation in the ancient technology of money. At its core, money simply
facilitates the exchange of value between people like retail, contract services, Web
store, and Charitable donations

#### Getting Started

Bitcoin is a protocol that can be accessed using a client application that speaks the
protocol. A “bitcoin wallet” is the most common user interface to the bitcoin system.

#### Choosing a Bitcoin Wallet

Bitcoin wallets can be categorized as follows, according to the platform:

* A desktop wallet was the first type of bitcoin wallet created as a reference
  implementation and many users run desktop wallets for the features, autonomy, and
  control they offer.
* A mobile wallet is the most common type of bitcoin wallet. Running on smartphone
  operating systems such as Apple iOS and Android, these wallets are often a great choice
  for new users.
* Web wallets are accessed through a web browser and store the user’s wallet on a server
  owned by a third party.
* Hardware wallets are devices that operate a secure self-contained bitcoin wallet on
  special-purpose hardware.
* The keys controlling bitcoin can also be printed for long-term storage. These are known
  as paper wallets even though other materials (wood, metal, etc.) can be used.

Another way to categorize bitcoin wallets is by their degree of autonomy and how they
interact with the bitcoin network:

* Full-node client, a client that stores the entire history of bitcoin transactions (every
  transaction by every user, ever), manages users’ wallets, and can initiate transactions
  directly on the bitcoin network.
* Lightweight client, A lightweight client, also known as a simple-payment-verification (
  SPV) client, connects to bitcoin full nodes (mentioned previously) for access to the
  bitcoin transaction information, but stores the user wallet locally and independently
  creates, validates, and transmits transactions. Lightweight clients interact directly
  with the bitcoin network, without an intermediary.
* hird-party API client, A third-party API client is one that interacts with bitcoin
  through a third-party system of application programming interfaces (APIs), rather than
  by connecting to the bitcoin network directly. The wallet may be stored by the user or
  by thirdparty servers, but all transactions go through a third party.

A mobile wallet is best for new users like Mycelium and Exodus.

A wallet is simply a collection of addresses and the keys that unlock the funds within.
Bitcoin addresses start with a 1 or 3. They can be shared with other bitcoin users who can
use them to send bitcoin directly to your wallet.

Until the moment this address is referenced as the recipient of value in a transaction
posted on the bitcoin ledger, the bitcoin address is simply part of the vast number of
possible addresses that are valid in bitcoin. Only once it has been associated with a
transaction does it become part of the known addresses in the network.

#### Getting Your First Bitcoin

* Find a friend who has bitcoin and buy some from him or her directly
* Use a bitcoin ATM in your city, [https://coinatmradar.com/](https://coinatmradar.com/)

#### Finding the Current Price of Bitcoin

“Who sets the bitcoin price?” The short answer is that the price is set by markets.
