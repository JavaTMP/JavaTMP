inside each project there is a gulp task that run a local web server.
So you can use it for testing purposes by running the following command:
(make sure first that node.js is installed in your machine):
```
npm install
gulp run-local-web-server
```

the above command will run a local web server listening
on port 8888 and context root "web". To access the application
