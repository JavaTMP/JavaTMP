## Free Gradle script to compile and build a Java project:

The gradle plugin provides the flexibility to configure the plugin based on the project's need as the following
code snippt shows:

```
apply plugin:'java'
task cleanDir << {
    delete "build"
    delete "dist"
}
task createDirs(dependsOn:'cleanDir') << {
    def classes = file("build/classes")
    def dist = file("dist")
    classes.mkdirs()
    dist.mkdirs()
}
compileJava {
    File classesDir = file("build/classes")
    FileTree srcDir = fileTree(dir: "src")
    source srcDir
    destinationDir classesDir
}
task createJar(type: Jar) {
    destinationDir = file("dist")
    baseName = "JavaProject-1.0"
    from "build/classes"
}
createJar.dependsOn compileJava
compileJava.dependsOn createDirs
```

## Migrating from a Maven to Gradle project

- A user needs to rewrite the Maven script to the Gradle script. The following are some of the concepts
that will help you to smoothly migrate from Maven to Gradle:
    - Plugin declaration
    To include a plugin, the user only needs to write the `apply plugin` statement like: `apply plugin: '<plugin name>'`
    - Common conventions
    If a user includes a plugin and follows the same convention, then he can avoid writing any boiler-plate code
    that could save both his time and effort.
    If a user includes a java plugin, the common convention is that the source code location should be `src/main/java`,
    test code location should be `src/test/java`
    - Dependency management. To define the dependency in Gradle, a user has to use the following syntax:

```
dependencies{
    compile(' org.apache.logging.log4j: log4j-core:1.2')
}
```
    - Repositories configuration. This is the location from where you download dependencies.
    In Gradle, you can mention the repository using the following syntax:
```
repositories {
    maven {
        url "http://companylocalrepository.org"
    }
}
```

## Publishing artifacts
- You can execute the `gradle â€“b build.gradle uploadArchives` command to upload the artifacts.
As a part of life cycle, it will build and upload the artifacts.
- Gradle gives you the flexibility to upload the file to a local file system using `flatDir`.
- Gradle has a `maven-publish` plugin to have more control over the publishing process.
It gives you many additional flexibilities along with the default publish tasks.
A user can modify the POM file, publish multiple modules, and so on.
You can find more details at https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html.
- The following is the sample example of the build file to upload a JAR file generated by a `java plugin`:
```
apply plugin: 'java'
version=1.0
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
  compile ('log4j:log4j:1.2.16')
}
uploadArchives {
  repositories {
    maven {
      credentials {
        username "user1"
        password "user1"
      }
      url "http://company.private.repo"
    }
  }
}
```
