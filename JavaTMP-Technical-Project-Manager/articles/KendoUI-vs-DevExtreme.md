### Integration with Spring Boot

Both Kendo UI and DevExtreme can be effectively integrated with a Spring Boot backend. Here are some general steps and tips for integration:

1. **API Communication**: Use tools like Axios, Fetch API, or the framework’s HTTP client (e.g., Angular’s HttpClient) to communicate with your Spring Boot REST API.

2. **Security**: Implement OAuth2 and JWT for secure API communication. Handle token generation and validation in Spring Boot, and manage token storage and usage in your front-end application.

3. **State Management**: Use state management libraries suitable for your chosen framework (Redux for React, Vuex for Vue, NgRx for Angular).

4. **Build and Deployment**:
    - **Build**: Use Webpack, Vite, or the framework’s build tool to bundle your front-end code.
    - **Deployment**: Deploy the front-end code on the same server as your Spring Boot application or host it separately.

5. **UI Integration**: Leverage the component libraries to build dynamic and responsive UIs, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Summary

**Kendo UI** is ideal if you need a comprehensive, highly customizable component library with extensive documentation and support. It's particularly suitable for large projects where the cost can be justified by the range of features and components provided.

**DevExtreme** (ExtremeJS) is also a powerful choice, especially if you need advanced data visualization and grid features. It offers a balance of customization and performance, with strong support for modern frameworks.

Ultimately, the choice between Kendo UI and DevExtreme should be based on your specific project requirements, budget, and the expertise of your development team. Both are excellent choices for building a professional and robust front-end for a Spring Boot application.
